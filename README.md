# **PatrOwl**
[PatrOwl](https://www.patrowl.io/) is a scalable, free and open-source solution for orchestrating Security Operations.  
**PatrowlManager** is the Front-end application for managing the assets, reviewing risks on real-time, orchestrating the operations (scans, searches, API calls, ...), aggregating the results, relaying alerts on third parties (ex: Incident Response platform like [TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/), Splunk, ...) and providing the reports and dashboards. Operations are performed by the [PatrowlEngines](https://github.com/Patrowl/PatrowlEngines/) instances. Don't forget to install and deploy them ;)

# Installation
